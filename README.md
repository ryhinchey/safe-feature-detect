# safe-feature-detect

Safe Feature Detect is heavily inspired by the great [Feature.js](http://featurejs.com/).  Like Feature.js, this library stays under 1kb minified & gzipped. 
In addition, Safe Feature Detect caches detections and will not throw an error during server side rendering.

## Installation

## Usage
